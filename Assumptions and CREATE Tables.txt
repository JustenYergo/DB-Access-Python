ASSUMPTIONS:

One assumption I made was when I didn't put the rental information like daily and weekly rates into the car table. I needed it to show the rates at a glance when printing
the information in my html website. You won't see them in my ERR or my relational schema because I only realized I needed them while making the Python program. 
Another assumption I made was the update transactions. It says in the homework they are meant to print the data, but I also made a function to update the date 
in the database based on user input.

CREATE TABLES:

create database CAR_RENTAL;



use CAR_RENTAL;



create table CUSTOMER(

    IDNo int auto_increment not null,

    Name varchar(20) not null,

    Phone varchar(12) not null,

    primary key (IDNo)

    );



create table CAR(

    VehicleID int auto_increment not null,

    Year int(4) not null,

    Model varchar(15) not null,

    Type enum("Truck", "Van", "SUV", "Large", "Medium", "Compact") not null,

    primary key (VehicleID)

    );
